My solutions to the Google foo.bar challengs

The challengs have five levels, level i has exactly i questions.
The questions with solutions are labelled as level-number_XXX.java.

I developed these solutions except the last one, and all of them passed the goole tests.
Comments are added so readers can understand my logic.

Note: for the last problem 5-2, it is NP-hard, and I found a solution from stackexchange.com (N <= 15)

Enjoy!
